# TheCodeOfBeekeeping

## WWDC 19 Playground Submission

My goal with this playground was to familiarise the user with the basics of beekeeping and make them become aware of how important they are to us. This lead me to the structure that you are now experiencing: starting from the parts of the hive, zooming out to the practice of beekeeping and ending with the impact that bees have on our fields.

The PlaygroundSupport framework made possible to write code that users could safely manipulate while allowing them to see the results and interact with the live view. Using autocompletion and assessments to guide the user towards the learning objective. The end result was very satisfying, to see how the logic from beekeeping, which has nothing to do with code, could be effectively taught through it. 

In this playground book Iâ€™ve made extensive use of UIKit, along with other frameworks such as AVFoundation to play the humming of bees and Core Graphics to 3D animate the presentation of cells. Other features I implemented were the use of timers to constantly update some of the views in the ViewControllers and Keyframe animations to move the bees over the grid. Writing reusable code really helped me speed trough the creation of the live view.
